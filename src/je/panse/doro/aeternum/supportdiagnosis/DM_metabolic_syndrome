3.2 Strong associations of the metabolic syndrome include:
1. Polycystic ovary disease
2. Acanthosis nigricans
3. Decreased fibrinolytic activity
4. Hyperuricaemia
5. Pro-inflammatory state (elevated highly sensitivity CRP)
6. Microalbuminuria


Table 4. Clinical Classification of BMI
Classification of BMI (kg/m2)
Underweight <18.5
Normal weight 18.6-24.9
Overweight 25-29.9
Obesity (class 1) 30-34.9
Obesity (class 2) 35-39.9
Extreme obesity (class3) >40
The pattern of distribution of the fat in the body (whether mostly peripherally or 
centrally distributed) is assessed by the use of the waist hip ratio (WHR):
WHR= waist circumference (cm)/Hip circumference (cm)


 General examination
 Height/ weight/ BMI
 Examination of feet (e.g. ulcers, loss of sensation)
 Examination of eyes (e.g. cataracts, diabetic retinopathy)
 Blood pressure measurement
 Examination of peripheral pulses

The clinical spectrum of cardiovascular disease is:
a) Coronary heart disease:
 Angina (which may be silent).
 Acute coronary artery syndrome.
 Congestive cardiac failure.
 Sudden death. 
b) Cerebrovascular accident:
 Stroke.
 Transient Ischaemic Attacks.
 Dementia. 
c) Peripheral vascular disease:
 Intermittent claudication.
 Foot ulcers.
 Gangrene.


There are three major categories:
 Peripheral neuropathy
 Autonomic neuropathy
 Acute onset neuropathies,
Clinical Assessment:
 Detailed history: numbness, tingling, pain.
 Examination of the feet: test for sensation using 10 g monofilament, 
128 Hz tuning fork or cotton wool.
 Lying and then standing blood pressure (postural hypotension= Drop 
in systolic BP > 20mmHg or diastolic >10mmHg) and pulse.


Cornerstones of Management of Foot Problems
 Identification of the foot “at risk” 
 Regular inspection and examination of the foot at risk.
 Education of health workers, people with diabetes and their families.
 Appropriate footwear.
 Early treatment of non-ulcerative and ulcerative problems.
