How to examine using the 10 g (5.07 Semmes-Weinstein) monofilament
 This should be done in a quiet and relaxed setting.
 First apply the monofilament on the patient’s hands (or elbow, or 
forehead) so that the patient knows what to expect. 
 The patient must not be able to see if and where the examiner applies 
the filament.
 Apply the monofilament perpendicular to the skin surface with 
sufficient force to cause the filament to bend or buckle.
 The total duration of the approach, skin contact, and removal of the 
filament should be approximately 2 seconds.
 Apply the filament along the perimeter of, and not on, an ulcer site, 
callus, scar or necrotic tissue. 
 Do not allow the filament to slide across the skin or make repetitive 
contact at the test site.
 Press the filament to the skin and ask the patient IF he or she 
feels the pressure applied (yes/no) and then WHERE the applied 
pressure is felt (left/right foot).
 Repeat this application twice at the same site, but alternate this with 
at least one “sham” application, in which no filament is applied (total 
three questions per site).
 Protective sensation is present at each site if the patient correctly 
answers two out of three applications. Protective sensation is absent

with two out of three incorrect answers, and the patient is then 
considered to be at risk of ulceration.
 Encourage the patient during testing.
At the examination each person’s feet must be categorized into: LOW RISK or 
HIGH RISK.
